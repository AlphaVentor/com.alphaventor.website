			<h1><b>Contracting</b></h1>
			<h1>Contracts That Protect You – Before a Single Bolt is Turned</h1>
			<h2>Building Bulletproof Protection into Every Clause</h2>
			<p>With one decade of hands-on experience in executing complex thermal, ORC, and Oil & Gas projects,
				we know exactly where risks hide and how contractors try to shift them. We translate this hard-won
				insight into clear, balanced-yet-firm contractual frameworks (EPC, EPCM, split contracts, or hybrid
				models)
				that lock in scope, performance guarantees, schedule milestones, and payment terms while keeping your
				interests
				first.
			</p>
			<h2>Turning Obligations into Guaranteed Performance</h2>
			<p>We craft incentive mechanisms, liquidated damages, performance bonds, and testing protocols that leave no
				room for ambiguity. From steam turbine efficiency and ORC output to district heating availability and
				datacenter cooling reliability, every key indicator you care about becomes contractually enforceable.
				The result is not just a signed agreement – it’s the peace of mind that comes from knowing your project
				will deliver exactly what you paid for.</p>

			<h1><b>Sizing</b></h1>
			<h1>Size It Once, Build It Right – No Costly Surprises Later</h1>
			<h2>Auditing Your Process with Ruthless Precision</h2>
			<p>Before any euro is committed, we dive deep into your existing or planned process streams, energy
				balances, and operational constraints. Using proven thermodynamic modeling, real-world data
				reconciliation, and scenario analysis, we uncover hidden inefficiencies, oversizing traps, or
				underestimated peak loads that typical feasibility studies miss – whether it’s a district heating
				network, an ORC waste-heat recovery unit, a datacenter cooling loop, or a compressed-gas facility.</p>
			<h2>Defining the Key Metrics That Actually Matter</h2>
			<p>We deliver a crystal-clear sizing report with verifiable key performance indicators: exact thermal duty,
				optimum turbine or compressor power, realistic turndown ratios, annual energy yield, and lifecycle cost
				curves. These aren’t theoretical numbers – they become the unbreakable foundation for specifications,
				tenders, and contracts, ensuring your plant is neither underpowered nor wastefully oversized, but
				perfectly dimensioned for performance and profitability from day one.</p>

			<h1><b>Supervising</b></h1>
			<h1>Signed Doesn’t Mean Finished – We Stay Until It’s Perfectly Delivered</h1>
			<h2>Real-Time Oversight That Keeps Everyone Accountable</h2>
			<p>From kick-off meeting to final performance test, we act as your eyes and ears on the ground. We monitor
				engineering progress, manufacturing milestones, quality inspections, and site installation with a
				structured dashboard, regular audits, and on-site presence when needed. Deviations from schedule, scope
				creep, or early signs of technical shortcuts are caught immediately – long before they become expensive
				claims.</p>
			<h2>Enforcing the Performance You Paid For</h2>
			<p>Using the contractual levers we built from day one (milestone payments, LDs, acceptance protocols), we
				drive the selected EPC or OEM to respect every commitment: turbine isentropic efficiency, ORC net
				output, boiler availability, or cooling-system redundancy. The result is not just a project that
				finishes – it’s a project that finishes on time, on budget, and performs exactly as promised from the
				very first day of operation.</p>

			<h1><b>Storage</b></h1>
			<h1>Your Project’s Memory, Secured Forever – Nothing Lost, Nothing Forgotten</h1>
			<h2>Keeping track of every Document</h2>
			<p>From the first feasibility note to final as-built drawings, we implement a secure, structured, and fully
				searchable documentation system from day one. Specifications, vendor data sheets, meeting minutes,
				calculation notes, certificates, test reports, change orders – everything is captured,
				version-controlled, and instantly accessible to your team, eliminating the classic “where is that file?”
				delays that plague most projects.</p>
			<h2>Safeguarding Knowledge for Operation, Claims, and Beyond</h2>
			<p>We don’t just store – we protect and future-proof. All documents are classified, backed-up in redundant
				locations, and delivered in open formats with clear indexing so that years later, during audits,
				warranty claims, revamping, or replication projects, you can retrieve the exact evidence you need in
				minutes. The result: total traceability, bulletproof defense against disputes, and a living knowledge
				base that turns your finished plant into a repeatable success.</p>

			<h1><b>Integration</b></h1>
			<h1>One Package, Perfectly Woven into the Whole – for Seamless and Smooth operation</h1>
			<h2>Seeing the Big Picture When Others See Only Their Scope</h2>
			<p>Your new ORC turbogenerator, boiler, or gas compressor isn’t an island. We map every interface –
				mechanical, electrical, control, fluid, thermal, and civil – with the existing plant or parallel
				packages long before steel is ordered. By leading coordination meetings, producing integration matrices,
				and delivering unified P&IDs, loop diagrams, and 3D models, we eliminate the classic finger-pointing
				that arises when separate suppliers work in silos.</p>
			<h2>Delivering a Plant That Starts Up Like Clockwork</h2>
			<p>We go beyond coordination: at your request, we take full responsibility for integration scope – from
				common platforms and shared utilities to DCS logic, alarm management, and overall sequence of operation.
				The outcome is a turnkey handover where the new equipment doesn’t just work in isolation; it boosts the
				performance, reliability, and efficiency of the entire system, with first-time start-up success and zero
				post-commissioning surprises.</p>

			<h1><b>Design</b></h1>
			<h1>From Vision to Reality – We Design It, Then Make It Real</h1>
			<h2>Creating Tailor-Made Solutions That Actually Work</h2>
			<p>We don’t do off-the-shelf. Our in-house team designs custom process plants and equipment with deep
				expertise in thermal systems (boilers, district heating, datacenter cooling), advanced thermodynamic
				cycles (steam, ORC, sCO₂), and high-performance turbomachinery (expanders, turbocompressors, ORC
				turbogenerators). Every design is born from your specific energy, footprint, and budget constraints –
				optimized for efficiency, operability, and long-term value.</p>
			<h2>From Concept to Production-Ready Deliverables</h2>
			<p>We take the idea all the way: process flow diagrams, heat & mass balances, detailed mechanical design, 3D
				modeling, stress analysis, and full manufacturing drawings. Because we also handle procurement and
				supervision, our designs are inherently buildable, cost-aware, and de-risked – ready for fabrication by
				the best shops worldwide, with zero disconnect between what was imagined and what gets delivered on
				site.</p>

			<h1><b>Scaling</b></h1>
			<h1>From Prototype to Thousands – We Scale Your Success Without Compromise</h1>
			<h2>Matching Your Design to True High-Volume Champions</h2>
			<p>When your ORC turbogenerator, heat exchanger, or specialized compressor moves from pilot to commercial
				series, we rapidly identify and qualify the few OEMs worldwide that combine proven high-volume
				manufacturing capability with the technical rigor your product demands. We go beyond standard
				directories – targeting hidden leaders in Asia, Europe, and North America that already produce similar
				rotating or thermal equipment at rates of hundreds or thousands per year.</p>
			<h2>Securing Quality, Cost, and Speed at Scale</h2>
			<p>We structure the partnership for seamless transfer: detailed manufacturing drawings, tolerance stack-up
				reviews, dedicated tooling packages, and rigorous qualification runs. Then we negotiate capacity
				reservation, stepped pricing curves, and quality gates that protect performance even at peak production.
				The result is your equipment rolling off the line at the lowest possible unit cost, with zero drift in
				efficiency or reliability – ready for global deployment from the very first commercial batch.</p>
